# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A game of Rock Paper Scissors. Bugs possible.
Input player names, firstly. Be careful not to screw up the names or else it will think that what you put in is all one name.
Next, put in rock, paper, or scissors. I still haven't figured out how to clear the console, so cover up your inputs. Also be careful of what you put in. 
If it all works, then you should get a winner ot a tie.
Comment on this and give me suggestions on what to do (I'm using Windows 7)
